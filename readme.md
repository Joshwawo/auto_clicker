# Auto Clicker
## An auto clicker is a program that clicks the mouse for you.
It is useful for games like Cookie Clicker.
It is also useful for games that require you to click a lot.

I created this to use it for Black Ops 3 zombies to roll Liquid Divinium.

## How to Use
1. Run the program.
2. Click anywhere on the screen to start clicking.
3. Press the escape key to stop clicking.
4. Press the 0 key to re-enable clicking.
5. Press 1 to change the interval between clicks, in seconds.
